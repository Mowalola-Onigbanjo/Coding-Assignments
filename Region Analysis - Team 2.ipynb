    "Northern Africa is usually refers to the northernmost region of the African continent, stretching from the Atlantic shores of Morocco in the west to the Suez Canal and the Red Sea in the east <a href=\"https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Northern_Africa\">(Source)</a> and is a politically heterogeneous region  with a size of roughly 3.3 mission square miles, it is comparable to the United States of America. Some of its countries (such as Egypt and Morocco) have stable governments while others (Chad and Libya, for example) are plagued by civil wars <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/index.php/the-next-five-years/middle-east-and-north-africa\">(Source)</a>. A significant amount of oil is found in western and central African coastal plains and continental shelfs. The largest producer of oil in the region is Libya <a href=\"https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/libyanoil.html\">(Source)</a>.  Water supply has always been a big factor in deciding where people live and how they live across the region. 95% of Egypt's population lives on the Mediterranean Sea, a short distance from the Nile or the delta <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/print_eg.html\">(Source)</a>. Lands of corn, vegetables, cotton, and other crops are irrigated with river waters. The most significant feature of North Africa's population is that it is more uniform than the population of any other African region <a href=\"https://geography.name/north-africa-geography-and-population/#:~:text=The%20most%20significant%20feature%20of,mixture%20of%20the%20two%20groups\">(Source)</a> Although minority populations exist in all five nations, most North Africans are either Arabs, Berbers, or a mix of both groups. According to the Köppen climate classification, the region lies in the warm desert climate  Almost the entire region is covered by the desert. Temperatures in this region peak at around 104°F in the summer months<a href=\"https://geography.name/climate-2/\">(Source)</a>. . Due to their location in the subtropical high pressure belt, rain is limited to 300mm maximum per month <a href=\"https://traveltips.usatoday.com/climate-landforms-north-africa-105976.html\">(Source)</a>. \n"
